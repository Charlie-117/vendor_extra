# MotoMods

To include in build clone into ```vendor/extra``` and change MOTOMODS_PATH  
Many custom ROMs call the makefile in this path, but make sure that you check it first.  

# Goodies

- Replaces some apps with alternatives  
    - Jelly with DuckDuckGo Browser, Jelly is a good lightweight browser but I prefer DDG.  
    - Gallery with Simple Gallery.  
- Removes Email App.  
- A bash script to quickly update the APKs.  
- Added various Motorola ringtones and notification sounds.  
- A [manifest](scripts/crdroid-8916.xml) file for fun.  
- Calls MindTheGapps makefile if present.
